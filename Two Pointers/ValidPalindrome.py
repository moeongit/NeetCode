# Valid Palindrome
# Solved

# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

# Output: true

# Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "tab a cat"

# Output: false
